**Why is Documentation so underrated?**

**Picture this**: Your teammate goes on vacation. An urgent request lands on your desk, and you open his Power BI report to find a chaotic and massive data model. You scramble for documentation, only to discover a dump of all the DAX measures in the model... Familiar pain? 

**That's the pain of poor documentation.**

Hereâ€™s the thing: documentation isnâ€™t just about writing things down. Itâ€™s about creating a map that helps everyone: your teammates, stakeholders, and even future-you. Itâ€™s not glamorous, but when done right, it can save hours, spark better collaboration, and even rescue projects from chaos.

This topic got me and **Greg Philps** thinking: **What should the Power BI community invest more time in learning, from our perspective, to make a difference?** And, honestly, documentation doesnâ€™t get the attention it deserves. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re diving deeper to propose something the community can actually use in their daily work.

Starting this week, **Greg** and I will alternate posting ideas and hopefully useful actionable tips about Power BI Documentation. These posts will cover different topics related to documentation. 

Weâ€™ll save them all on a dedicated **GitHub repo** for easy reference.

How far can we take this? Thatâ€™s up to you. Jump in, share your thoughts, suggest ideas, challenge our approaches, or propose topics for us to explore. Letâ€™s transform documentation from aÂ  sidekick to the true hero it deserves to be.

**Letâ€™s go!** ðŸš€
